# Neural-Network-Visualiser

## Description:
This is a Neural Network Visualizer Web Application using Streamlit, and a simple model server using Keras and Flask.
Keras is used to train a Neural Network model, and Keras' functional API is used to create a model with multiple outputs. A web application is created that will visualize the outputs of all the nodes of all the layers of the neural network for a given input image.
